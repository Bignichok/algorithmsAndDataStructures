## Singly Linked Lists

-   Linked list is a data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
-   Linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.
-   singly linked lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning
    are frequently required
-   the idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures
    like Stacks and Queues

### Lists

-   Do not have indexes
-   Connected via nodes with a next pointer
-   Random access is not allowed

### Arrays

-   Indexed in order!
-   Insertion and deletion can be expensive
-   Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
