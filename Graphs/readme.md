##Graphs
- Graph - is a data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable)
  set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs
  of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

  ###Graph terms
  -Vertex - a node
  -Edge - connection between nodes
  -Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
  -Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

  ### use cases
  - social networks
  - location / mapping
  - routing algorithms
  - visual hierarchy
  - file system optimizations
  - everywhere
