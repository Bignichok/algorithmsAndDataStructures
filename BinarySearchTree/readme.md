##Trees

-   Root - the top node in a tree.
-   Child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
-   Parent - the converse notion of a child.
-   Siblings - group of nodes with the same parent.
-   Leaf - a node with no children.
-   Edge - the connection between one node and another.

###Binary search trees

-   Every parent node has at most two children
-   Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
-   Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent
-   O (log n) in average case

###Use cases

-   HTML DOM
-   Network routing
-   Abstract syntax tree
-   Artificial Intelligence
-   Folders in Operating Systems
-   Computer file system
