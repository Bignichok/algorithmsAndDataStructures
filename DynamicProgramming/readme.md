##Dynamic programming

WTF IS?
- A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down
into a collection of simpler subProblems, solving each of those
subProblems just once, and storing their solutions

###Overlapping subProblems
- A problem is said to have overlapping subProblems if it can be broken down into subProblems which are reused several times

###Optimal subProblems
A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution
can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subProblems
